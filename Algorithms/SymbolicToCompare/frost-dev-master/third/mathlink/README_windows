Thanks to Radovan Palik for the following working solution.


How to build the Mathematica Symbolic Toolbox for MATLAB on Windows:

1. Requirements:
    a) Mathematica 5.0 (4.x ???)
    b) Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 (2002 ???, VC++ 6.0 ???)
    c) MATLAB 7

2. Setup mex compiler:

  >> mex -setup

  and select MS Visual Studio .NET  (will not work with lcc or bcc32 compilers, ml32i1m.lib created with MSVC)

3. Compile math.c

 >> mex -D__STDC__ -IC:\Mathematica\5.0\AddOns\MathLink\DeveloperKit\Windows\CompilerAdditions\mldev32\include math.c C:\Mathematica\5.0\AddOns\MathLink\DeveloperKit\Windows\CompilerAdditions\mldev32\lib\ml32i1m.lib

  (use your paths to include folder (mathlink.h) and ml32i1m.lib!!!)

  see makewin32.m for a script to compile math.c for windows

4. Add Mathematica console core (math.exe - comes with Mathematica) to PATH and enjoy ;-) 



   math.dll is included as a precompiled dll for win32 systems.



Amir Rosenthal has also written some instructions (but in more detail) in "Installation
instructions for windows.doc". He has also contributed a precompiled math.dll in
math_windows.zip.

Unzip math_windows.zip into its own directory and follow the instructions.
