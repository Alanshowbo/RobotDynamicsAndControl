snopt-matlab
============

Matlab interface for sparse nonlinear optimization software SNOPT.

Requires the SNOPT software package.

These files are included in the SNOPT distribution.

The mex directory contains the actual Matlab-Fortran interface files for SNOPT.  These files are only needed if you have a full copy of SNOPT and want to build new Matlab mex-files.

The matlab directory contains the Matlab m-files needed to run SNOPT via Matlab.

Examples are located in the directory matlab/examples.

If you downloaded the evaluation or student version of SNOPT and need the Matlab m-files and examples, the files are located in the matlab directory.

Documentation for the Matlab interface available <a href="http://ccom.ucsd.edu/~elwong/p/snoptMatlab.pdf">here</a>.
